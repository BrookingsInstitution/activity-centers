All block-group level data used in our analysis, as well as some additional block-group data that was collected but not used, can be found in the four subdirectories of this directory.  The data is presented as a CSV file in Block_Group_Data--CSV, as a R data file in Block_Group_Data--RDS, as a geoJSON file linked to 2020 Census block group geometries in Block_Group_Data--geoJSON, and as an ESRI Shapefile linked to 2020 Census block group geometries in Block_Group_Data--ESRI_Shapefile.

Data dictionaries for this data are present as a CSV file (Block_Group_Data_Dictionary.csv) and an Excel spreadsheet (Block_Group_Data_Dictionary.xlsx).  It should be noted that all Smart Location Database, American Community Survey, 2010 Decennial Census, and Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics data was originally tabulated in 2010 Census geometries and has been converted to 2020 Census geometries as discussed in the methodological appendix.

Certain variables have the value of NA for block groups with a total land area greater than 100 square miles, as these block groups were excluded from some analyses on the basis that they are too large to reasonably describe "centers" or specific places.
