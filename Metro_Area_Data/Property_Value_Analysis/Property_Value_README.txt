This directory contains three files of data from our analysis of property values using Zillow.  The two CSV files are copies of the two tabs of the "Property Value Analysis.xlsx" spreadsheet.  The commercial property tab shows commercial land values in primary (major), secondary (minor), and monocenters, as well as elsewhere in the rest of the MSA for each of the 45 MSAs for which we have reliable land value data.  The residential property tab shows residential property values per square foot of building area for residential properties within a half-mile and a one-mile buffer of activity centers in each metro area, as well as for properties outside each buffer.  Note that Columbia, SC is excluded from this dataset because of data quality issues.
